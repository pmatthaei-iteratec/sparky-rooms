# Tensorflow Model for Person Detection on a Microcontroller

## Goal

The model should detect how many people are residing in a meeting room and retrieve their bounding boxes from a single greyscale image input.
Transforming the image into bird eye view via [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) allows to measure distances between the detected people using the already found bounding boxes.

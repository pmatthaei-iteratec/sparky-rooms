# SparkFun Edge - Person detection

This project aims at deploying a person detection model on a SparkFun Edge board.
Via the camera included on the board, persons in a meeting room should be counted
and their distance to each other can be measured.
With this data we can determine if a room is empty or filled, if people comply to the
corona restrictions and more.
